        "# A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.\n",
        "# It maps outcomes of a random process to real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2 What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "# There are two types: Discrete (countable values) and Continuous (any value in a range).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3 What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "# Discrete: Deals with countable values (e.g., number of heads in coin toss).\n",
        "# Continuous: Deals with uncountable, infinite values within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4 What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "# PDF defines the probability of a continuous random variable falling within a range of values.\n",
        "# It describes the density, not the exact probability at a point (which is 0 for continuous vars).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5 How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?\n",
        "# CDF gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
